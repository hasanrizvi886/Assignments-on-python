    "**Que1.** Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans1.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions provide several advantages in programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.Modularity: Functions allow you to break down your program into smaller, manageable, and reusable chunks of code. By organizing your code into functions, you can tackle complex problems by dividing them into simpler, focused tasks. This modular approach enhances code readability, maintainability, and reusability.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2.Code Reusability: Functions can be defined once and used multiple times throughout your program or even in other programs. This promotes code reuse, reduces redundancy, and helps in maintaining a clean and efficient codebase. Instead of rewriting the same code in multiple places, you can simply call the function wherever it's needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Abstraction: Functions enable abstraction by hiding the internal implementation details and providing a higher-level interface. You can define a function with a well-defined purpose, input parameters, and expected output, without exposing the underlying implementation. This allows other parts of the program to use the function without needing to understand how it works internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Code Organization: Functions allow you to organize your code into logical blocks, improving code organization and structure. By encapsulating related code within functions, you can easily locate and manage specific functionality. This leads to cleaner and more maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. Readability and Debugging: Functions promote code readability by giving meaningful names to blocks of code and encapsulating logic into self-contained units. This makes it easier for developers to understand the purpose and behavior of the code. Additionally, functions help in debugging because you can isolate and test specific parts of the code independently, making it easier to identify and fix issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "    6.Scoping and Variable Management: Functions have their own local scope, allowing you to define variables that are only accessible within the function. This prevents naming conflicts and allows for better variable management. Functions can also accept arguments as inputs, enabling parameterization and making the code more flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, functions enhance code organization, reusability, readability, and maintainability, making programs more efficient, modular, and easier to understand and maintain.\n",

    "The code inside the function is not executed immediately upon definition. It is only executed when the function is called or invoked.\n",

    "To execute the code within a function, you need to call the function by using its name followed by parentheses (). This triggers the execution of the code inside the function's block. The function can be called multiple times at different points in your program, allowing you to reuse the code and perform the desired task whenever needed."

    "In a Python program, there can be one global scope and multiple local scopes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Global Scope**: The global scope refers to the outermost scope of a Python program or module. It is the scope in which variables, functions, and classes are defined at the top level of the program. Any variable defined outside of any function or class is considered to be in the global scope. The global scope is accessible from anywhere within the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Local Scopes**: Local scopes are created whenever a function or a class is defined. Each function or class definition introduces a new local scope. Local scopes are nested within the global scope and are used to store variables that are specific to that particular function or class. Variables defined within a local scope are only accessible within that scope or its nested scopes.\n"
